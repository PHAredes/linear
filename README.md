This is mainly me explaining the first part of the calculus implemented by Pierre Lescanne. Please don't take my notes for granted

I modified the structure of the ULC terms to comprehend some ideas from Connor McBride, Liam Oâ€™Connor and Oleg Grenrus just because they looked more natural for me to understand it

Also, most types uses different names because I don't like unicode that much
